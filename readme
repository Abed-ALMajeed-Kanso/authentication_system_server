This is the backend of the project, built with **Express.js** and connected to a **MongoDB Atlas** database. 
It handles user registration, login, authentication with JWT (stored in HttpOnly cookies), protected routes, and user data management.

Deployed on Render on the following link: https://authentication-system-server-csqa.onrender.com

Note: The server is hosted on Renderâ€™s free tier, which may enter a sleep mode when inactive. 
If the application gave errors, please contact me to refresh it (it needs a rebuild sometimes).
